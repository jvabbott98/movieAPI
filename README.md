REST API for storing data about movies. 

Through various endpoints(detailed in documentation.html) one can create new users, login,
search for users/movies, add favorite movies to a list, search for more details on genres and
directors, and delete userers. 

movieAPI is hosted on Heroku and draws from a database hosted on mongoDB Atlas.
